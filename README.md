# Linux_in_windows_office
Files and description of how use linux in a windows/office dominated workplace.  

This repo was made after i were allowed to dual-boot linux on my workstation. Windows is still needed for time-registration and economy, but hopefully at one point, it will be moved to a VM. 

List of software that is needed:
  1. Skype
  2. Outlook, e-mail client
  3. Outlook, exchange service for calendar.
  4. Office alternative.
